# 🌤️ Weather App

A simple and responsive Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript that allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather information including temperature and current conditions. The app fetches data from a weather API and dynamically updates the UI without using any frameworks. To run the project, clone the repository, navigate to the folder, and open `index.html` in your browser or use Live Server in VS Code.
